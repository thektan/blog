My experience while traveling to New Orleans a few months ago.

There's a feeling that's indescribable when I visit airports and ride on airplanes. It's a nice vibe  that makes me feel relaxed in a way. This was my second time flying on a plane and I was extremely excited to have this opportunity again. At the airport you see so many different people. Their expressions are different from the ones you see out and about in public. There's a mix of excited couples and families going on vacation and business people who you can just tell are frequent-flyers. It was a Wednesday so I didn't expect many people to be flying, but the airports were packed. The hoards of people made the airport experience less calming, but I still enjoyed the atmosphere.

I'm not a fan of roller coasters, but the feeling of lift-off is definitely my favorite part about flying. I love being able to look out the window and see the plane rising off the ground.

I'm looking forward to the next time I'll be able to ride a plane again!
