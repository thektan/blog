## Content Organization

In many of the sites I frequent, I've noticed a similar structure to the navigation bar.

On the left side you would find the logo and a search bar. On the right side you would find other links related to your account or create something new. The search bar field is open and ready to type a search term in. This would allow the user to do a quick search without wasting time clicking twice. Those sites though are web applications so the navigation bar gives the user access to a lot of the functions they would frequently use.

For sites more for just viewing, like portfolios, products, landing pages, the navigation bars look a bit different. The first thing I noticed was a more tucked away search bar or none at all. The search bar isn't made as a high priority. I've also noticed less icons and more text. Since the purpose of these pages are more for new users, icons aren't practical because unless it's a popularized magnifying glass icon for searching or a menu icon, icons are ambiguous and users won't know immediately what page they'll lead to.

The navigation bar still has lots of similarities to the navigation bars found on web application sites with the logo on the left or center followed by navigation links. For sites advertising a product, like the Dropbox site, the navigation bar also will have a "call to action" button that stands out from the other links.
