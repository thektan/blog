  Hi there! I'm Kevin. Thanks for visiting my blog!
  </p>

  <p>
  Adventure On is a place where I'll be journaling my adventures. The title comes from a double meaning of turning on my adventurous side and continuing to explore further. This is primarily a photo blog, but I might sneak in a thing or two about web development and design here and there.
