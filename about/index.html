  Hi there! I'm Kevin. Thanks for visiting my blog!
  </p>
  <p>
  Adventure On is a place where I'll be journaling my adventures. The title comes from a double meaning of turning on my adventurous side and continuing to explore further. This is primarily a photo blog, but I might sneak in a thing or two about web development and design here and there.

  I personally designed and developed this blog, so I hope you're liking what you see. If there are any issues you're running into, don't hesitate to leave me a message at <a href="mailto:hi@ktan.me">hi@ktan.me</a>. This blog was built using <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> and is hosted on <a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a>. Kudos to the authors of those tools for making my life a bit easier.
  </p>
  <p>I hope you continue to enjoy your time on my blog! Have a wonderful day!</p>
