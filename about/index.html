    <p>
        Hi there! I'm Kevin. Thanks for visiting my blog!
        <br/><br/>
        Adventure On is a place where I'll be journaling my adventures. The title comes from a double meaning of turning on my adventurous side and continuing to explore further. This is primarily a photo blog, but I might sneak in a thing or two about web development and design here and there.
        <br/><br/>
        I personally designed and developed this blog, so I hope you're liking what you see. If there are any issues you're running into, don't hesitate to leave me a message at <a href="mailto:hi@ktan.me">hi@ktan.me</a>. This blog was built using <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>. I've also used some super helpful javascript plugins to create this website:  
            <a href="http://www.appelsiini.net/projects/lazyload">Lazy Load</a>, 
            <a href="http://masonry.desandro.com/">Masonry</a>, 
            <a href="http://imagesloaded.desandro.com/">Images Loaded</a>, 
            <a href="http://modernizr.com/">Modernizr</a>, and 
            <a href="http://gsgd.co.uk/sandbox/jquery/easing/">jQuery Easing</a>.
        Thanks to the authors of those plugins for making my life a bit easier.
